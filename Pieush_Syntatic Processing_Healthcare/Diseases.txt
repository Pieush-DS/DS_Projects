Syntactic Processing (NLP)

Domain: Healthcare | Tech Stack: Python (NLP)

Problem Statement/Objective:
   To determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset and list it out in the form of a table or a dictionary.
   Companies like ‘BeHealthy’ are providing medical services, prescriptions and online consultations and generating huge data day by day.

Need to perform the following broad steps:
    Process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
    After that, need to define the features to build the CRF model.
    Then, need to apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
    Once the features are computed, need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
    Then, need to perform the evaluation using a test data set.
    At the end, need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.

Conclusion/Outcome:
As per the given data dictionary the treatment for the disease "hereditary retinoblastoma" is "radiotherapy".
