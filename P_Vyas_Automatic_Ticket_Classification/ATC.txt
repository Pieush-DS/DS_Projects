Problem Statement/Objective:

Need to build a model that can classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.

Need to do topic modelling on the ‘.json’ data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:
Credit card / Prepaid card
Bank account services
Theft/Dispute reporting
Mortgages/loans
Others

With the help of topic modelling, will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. This data can be used to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, one can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.

Conclusion:

The manual process of ticket classification in any ITSM Tool like ServiceNow or BMC Remedy can be effort-intensive and thus costly. A manual process will require 3 shifts to cover 24x7 operation.
With the developments in data science allowing for automated natural language processing and the ability to make classifications based on algorithms, it is possible to disrupt the manual process and bring dramatic improvement in efficiencies.
A solution in combination with the ITSM Tool to automate the process of classifying tickets to the appropriate type and hence assigning them to resolver groups could give a huge gain in operational efficiency and cost saving.
An algorithm including supervised and unsupervised models is a practical approach that can be used by any application maintenance project using any ITSM (ticketing tool). The input for this algorithm is text description with certain information. Supervised as well as unsupervised text analytics is applied to provide data insights in form of ticket classification.
