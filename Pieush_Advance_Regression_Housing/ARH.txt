Advance Regression housing analysis for ‘Surprise Housing'

Domain: Housing | Tech Stack: Python (ML model-Advance Regression)

Problem Statement/ Objective:

A US based housing company named 'Surprise Housing' has decided to enter the Australian market. The company user’s data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market, therefore required to build a model using regularisation to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company want to know the following things about the prospective properties:
A) Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house,
B) How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Business Goal:
Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. Accordingly, they can manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Conclusion:
  The Linear Regression model is very lengthy, time consuming and complex model to find out the top features of the model. The R-Square value for this model is 83.7%.
  The optimum value of Alpha for Ridge Regression is 10, whereas the R-Squared value for Train and Test data is 92.09% and 88.71% respectively.
  From all the above model it is concluded that Linear Regression Model is complex, lengthy and time consuming.
  Whereas among all the three Regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) Ridge model is faster, robust and simple.
  R-Squared value for Train and Test data is 92.09% and 88.71% which is highest among all the models, therefore we should go for Ridge Regression model for our purpose.
